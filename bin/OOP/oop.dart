      # OOP Paradigm: there are 4 advantages for follow oop programming.

          01. Correctness: code or logic that works correctly in software. Suppose,
                           if a click a fan but lights turn on. then it not correctness.
          02. Robustness: code or logic that reacts properly with the users.
                          For example: when a user put wrong password or login info then system
                          must react & stop user from login into the account. this is robustness.
          03. Extendibilty: Must be able to add new code or features with the old codes.
                            So, we you can extend our codes or features in future easily in
                            a system then this is a example of extendibilty.
          04. Reusability: Instead of coping & pasting the same code again & again.
                           the way of writing code once & use it in multiple place is
                           called Reusability.

      # OOP Pillars:

        01. Abstraction: To hide the mechanism or complexity of codes or software from users.
                         For example: a user drive a car but he/she doesn't care or think
                         whats going inside the car or it's mechanism.
        02. Polymorphism: Same things with different variation. For example: we human are same
                          but we have some variation like some are tall, some are short etc
        03. Inheritence: To get excess of something from someone due to relationship. For example: your father
                         has a property, so you will get that property from your father and later you can also add
                         something by your own there. Suppose, build a house on that property. Thus, your father own
                         that property but as a child you will excess to that property & also add new property by your own.
        04. Encapsulation: To hide or restrict codes or software mechanism from users. For example: It works like a capsule(medicine).
